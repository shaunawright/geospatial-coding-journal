# Week 1, Day 1 Progress Map ‚Äî 7 Modern Languages in 7 Weeks

**Date:** April 18, 2025  
**Student:** [Private User]  
**Track:** Spatial Analysis & Cartography Focus  
**Status:** ‚úÖ Day 1 Complete (Python)

---

## ‚úÖ Concepts Covered So Far
- **Variables** (e.g. `city_name = "Portland"`)
- **Conditionals** (`if`, `elif`, `else`)
- **Loops** (`for`, `while`)
- **Structured Data** using `list` of `dict`
- **f-strings** for clean string formatting

---

## ‚úÖ Real-World Examples Used
- Classifying cities by hemisphere based on latitude
- Looping through location dictionaries
- Classifying cities by population size
- Combining geographic and demographic logic in a single loop

---

## ‚úÖ Exercises Completed
1. Defined a simple variable (`map_scale`)
2. Wrote a conditional to classify city size
3. Used a `for` loop to print a list of countries
4. Analyzed hemisphere using latitudes
5. Classified cities as Mega, Major, or Small

### Go Further Challenge Completed
- Combined hemisphere + size classification into a single clean loop using nested conditionals

## üß≠ Next Learning Objective:
**Week 1, Day 2 ‚Äî TypeScript:**  
- Variables, `if` statements, and `forEach` loops  
- We'll compare how TypeScript handles structure, types, and loops compared to Python.

---

## üìù Practice Recommendations:
- Try looping through a list of GPS points and checking if they fall within a bounding box (e.g., "is this inside the USA?")
- Explore Python‚Äôs `range()` and `enumerate()` for more loop control
- Use `input()` to make your programs interactive

---

## üß† Useful Memory for Exercises
- Student has **some Python experience**
- Strong interest in **cartography** and **spatial data visualization**
- Is optimizing this track for **geospatial job market relevance**
- Replaced Julia with **JavaScript**
- May focus more heavily on **Python, JS, PostGIS, and R** later in the track

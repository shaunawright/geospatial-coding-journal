# Week 1, Day 2 Progress Map ‚Äî 7 Modern Languages in 7 Weeks

**Date:** April 18, 2025  
**Student:** [Private User]  
**Track:** Spatial Analysis & Cartography Focus  
**Status:** ‚úÖ Day 2 Complete (TypeScript)

---

## ‚úÖ Concepts Covered So Far
- Declaring typed variables (`let`, `const`)
- Defining custom types (`type City = { ... }`)
- Writing conditional logic with `if`, `else if`, `else`
- Looping through arrays using `.forEach()`
- Combining logic to classify geographic + demographic data

---

## ‚úÖ Exercises Completed
1. Declared a `mapScale` variable and printed it
2. Classified cities as Major or Small based on population
3. Loop through an array of countries and print each one
4. Identify hemisphere based on latitude
5. Combine population and latitude classification in one loop

### Go Further Challenge
- Used custom types, assigned properties directly to objects
- Applied clean and idiomatic TypeScript syntax

## üß≠ Next Learning Objective:
**Week 1, Day 3 ‚Äî SQL (PostgreSQL + PostGIS)**  
- Use `CASE WHEN` statements to classify cities
- Practice spatial logic in SQL: filtering based on lat/lon
- Learn SQL conditionals and loop-like queries

---

## üìù Practice Recommendations:
- Try converting your TypeScript logic into `.map()` to return a new array
- Use `switch` instead of `if` for the size classification
- Explore Leaflet or Mapbox GL JS to see how this logic could feed interactive maps

## üß† Useful Memory for Exercises
- Student has interest in cartography & geospatial data
- Focused on building job-relevant skills using Python, JS, PostGIS
- Likes seeing clean, expressive solutions with minimal syntax confusion
- Already using GitHub to publish `.md` logs and organize their learning journey

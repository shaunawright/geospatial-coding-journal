## Week 2 — Core Data Structures
- Lists, Dictionaries/Objects, Maps, Sets, Tuples
- Compare data handling across languages
- Spatial use: modeling points, features, bounding boxes

---

## Week 3 — File I/O and Web Data
- Read/write CSV, JSON, XML
- Create a tiny web server in each language
- Scrape map-based data sources (OpenStreetMap, city APIs)
- Parse GeoJSON-like structures

---

## Week 4 — Error Handling, Logging, and Tests
- Learn how each language handles runtime errors
- Write tests for spatial logic (city classification, bounding boxes)
- Add logging to a geoprocessing pipeline

---

## Week 5 — Object-Oriented & Functional Programming
- Create reusable models like `City`, `Feature`, `Point`
- Learn inheritance, traits, interfaces, and closures
- Build pipelines that transform and classify geo data

---

## Week 6 — Performance & Concurrency
- Speed up spatial processing with loops, async, threads
- Compare concurrency models: Go routines, Rust ownership, Python async
- Process large spatial datasets efficiently

---

## Week 7 — Real Libraries & Tools
- Use real geospatial libraries:
  - **Python**: GeoPandas, Shapely, FastAPI
  - **JS/TS**: Turf.js, Leaflet
  - **R**: `sf`, `leaflet`, `raster`
  - **SQL**: PostGIS
- Add tests and logging to production pipelines

---

## Week 8+ — Interview Prep (Optional)
- Algorithms in 7 languages
- Spatial queries and optimization
- Build a portfolio of completed challenges

---

## Learning Goals
✅ Compare core logic across 7 languages  
✅ Understand syntax, idioms, and paradigms  
✅ Build your own spatial classifiers and utilities  
✅ Deploy workflows using real-world tools  
✅ Learn new languages faster based on shared patterns

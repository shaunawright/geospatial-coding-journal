# Week 1, Day 4 Progress Map ‚Äî 7 Modern Languages in 7 Weeks

**Date:** April 17, 2025  
**Student:** [Private User]  
**Track:** Spatial Analysis & Cartography Focus  
**Status:** ‚úÖ Day 4 Complete (Rust)

---

## ‚úÖ Concepts Covered So Far
- Declaring variables with `let` and `mut`
- Numeric formatting with underscores for readability
- Using `if`, `else if`, and `match` statements
- Iterating over a `Vec` of custom structs
- Modeling data with `struct City`
- Using `String`, `&str`, and understanding ownership

---

## ‚úÖ Exercises Completed
1. Declared and printed a numeric variable (`map_scale`)
2. Classified population size with `if` logic
3. Created a `Vec<String>` and printed a list of countries
4. Defined a custom `City` struct and classified hemisphere
5. Used both `match` and `if` to classify each city by size and hemisphere

---

## ‚úÖ Go Further Example
- Discussed string ownership (`String` vs `&str`)
- Explored formatted printing with `println!` and `{}`
- Learned about Rust's strict memory model and struct field assignment
- Reviewed use of external crate `num-format` for comma-based number formatting

---

## üß≠ Next Learning Objective:
**Week 1, Day 5 ‚Äî Go (Golang):**  
- Learn `if`, `switch`, and `for` syntax in Go
- Compare Go's minimal, clean design to Rust and Python
- Practice loop logic with range-like control

---

## üìù Practice Recommendations:
- Write a function that takes a `City` and returns its classification string
- Explore `enum` instead of `String` for hemisphere and city size
- Try Rust Playground to test your match expressions live

---

## üß† Useful Memory for Exercises
- Student is now proficient with struct-based modeling
- Has strong understanding of branching logic and loop control
- Demonstrates strong attention to syntax rules and compiler feedback
- Has applied concepts to real-world examples involving cities and coordinates

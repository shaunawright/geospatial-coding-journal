# 7 Modern Languages in 7 Weeks — Spatial Data Focus

Welcome! This repository documents my journey learning 7 modern programming languages over 7 weeks, with a focus on **cartography**, **spatial analysis**, and **data visualization**.

## About Me
I have a background in cartography and geospatial data visualization. This project is part of my goal to strengthen my programming skills and transition into a more technical role in the GIS/data field.

## What You'll Find Here
Each week focuses on one core concept, explored across different languages:
- **Week 1:** Variables, Loops, and Conditionals
- **Week 2:** Data Structures
- **Week 3:** Files, Web Scraping, and Input/Output
- **Week 4:** Debugging, Testing, and Logging
- **Week 5:** Object-Oriented & Functional Programming
- **Week 6:** Concurrency & Performance
- **Week 7:** Real-World Tools — Web Servers, Scrapers, and Test Frameworks

## Language Track
- Python 3.12
- JavaScript (ES2024)
- PostgreSQL + PostGIS
- TypeScript 5.4
- R 4.4
- Go 1.22

## Progress
You'll find my daily `.md` progress maps in folders like `week_1/`, `week_2/`, etc. Each includes:
- What I learned that day
- The exercises I completed
- Code snippets and notes
- Links to docs and tools

---

## Week 2 — Core Data Structures
- Lists, Dictionaries/Objects, Maps, Sets, Tuples
- Compare data handling across languages
- Spatial use: modeling points, features, bounding boxes

---

## Week 3 — File I/O and Web Data
- Read/write CSV, JSON, XML
- Create a tiny web server in each language
- Scrape map-based data sources (OpenStreetMap, city APIs)
- Parse GeoJSON-like structures

---

## Week 4 — Error Handling, Logging, and Tests
- Learn how each language handles runtime errors
- Write tests for spatial logic (city classification, bounding boxes)
- Add logging to a geoprocessing pipeline

---

## Week 5 — Object-Oriented & Functional Programming
- Create reusable models like `City`, `Feature`, `Point`
- Learn inheritance, traits, interfaces, and closures
- Build pipelines that transform and classify geo data

---

## Week 6 — Performance & Concurrency
- Speed up spatial processing with loops, async, threads
- Compare concurrency models: Go routines, Rust ownership, Python async
- Process large spatial datasets efficiently

---

## Week 7 — Real Libraries & Tools
- Use real geospatial libraries:
  - **Python**: GeoPandas, Shapely, FastAPI
  - **JS/TS**: Turf.js, Leaflet
  - **R**: `sf`, `leaflet`, `raster`
  - **SQL**: PostGIS
- Add tests and logging to production pipelines

---

## Week 8+ — Interview Prep (Optional)
- Algorithms in 7 languages
- Spatial queries and optimization
- Build a portfolio of completed challenges

---

## Learning Goals
✅ Compare core logic across 7 languages  
✅ Understand syntax, idioms, and paradigms  
✅ Build your own spatial classifiers and utilities  
✅ Deploy workflows using real-world tools  
✅ Learn new languages faster based on shared patterns

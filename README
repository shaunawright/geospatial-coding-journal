# 7 Modern Languages in 7 Weeks — Spatial Data Focus

Welcome! This repository documents my journey learning 7 modern programming languages over 7 weeks, with a focus on **cartography**, **spatial analysis**, and **data visualization**.

## About Me
I have a background in cartography and geospatial data visualization. This project is part of my goal to strengthen my programming skills and transition into a more technical role in the GIS/data field.

## What You'll Find Here
Each week focuses on one core concept, explored across different languages:
- **Week 1:** Variables, Loops, and Conditionals
- **Week 2:** Data Structures
- **Week 3:** Files, Web Scraping, and Input/Output
- **Week 4:** Debugging, Testing, and Logging
- **Week 5:** Object-Oriented & Functional Programming
- **Week 6:** Concurrency & Performance
- **Week 7:** Real-World Tools — Web Servers, Scrapers, and Test Frameworks

## Language Track
- Python 3.12
- JavaScript (ES2024)
- PostgreSQL + PostGIS
- TypeScript 5.4
- R 4.4
- Go 1.22

## Progress
You'll find my daily `.md` progress maps in folders like `week_1/`, `week_2/`, etc. Each includes:
- What I learned that day
- The exercises I completed
- Code snippets and notes
- Links to docs and tools

# Week 1, Day 3 Progress Map ‚Äî 7 Modern Languages in 7 Weeks

**Date:** April 18, 2025  
**Student:** [Private User]  
**Track:** Spatial Analysis & Cartography Focus  
**Status:** ‚úÖ Day 3 Complete (SQL - PostgreSQL + PostGIS)

---

## ‚úÖ Concepts Covered So Far
- SQL SELECT basics
- Using `CASE WHEN` to classify values
- Filtering with `WHERE` clause
- Classifying cities by size and hemisphere
- Using subqueries for filtering on computed values

---

## ‚úÖ Exercises Completed
1. Selected names and populations from a cities table
2. Classified cities using `CASE WHEN` for population
3. Added latitude classification to identify hemispheres
4. Filtered cities to only Southern Hemisphere
5. Combined all logic in a subquery to show Major + Mega Cities with size and hemisphere classifications

---

## ‚úÖ Go Further Example
- Learned why alias names (like `size`) cannot be used in `WHERE` without subqueries
- Used a visual diagram to understand SQL processing order
- Wrote clean, real-world spatial classification logic

---

## üß≠ Next Learning Objective:
**Week 1, Day 4 ‚Äî Rust:**  
- Learn `match` statements and loops in Rust
- Explore how strict types and pattern matching differ from Python/TypeScript
- Focus on readable branching and robust loop control

---

## üìù Practice Recommendations:
- Write a query that finds cities near the equator (`lat BETWEEN -5 AND 5`)
- Try filtering using both `WHERE` and `CASE` to build more dynamic logic
- Install PostGIS or use a hosted spatial SQL playground to load shapefiles or GeoJSON

---

## üß† Useful Memory for Exercises
- Student has spatial interests (cartography, maps, city classification)
- Using GitHub to store `.md` files and code logs
- Now understands how subqueries help with `WHERE` clause filtering
- Mastered SQL conditional logic as used in real-world GIS tools
